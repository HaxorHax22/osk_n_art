                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Growing up in Reykjavík, I was surrounded by a landscape that changes with every season—volcanic rock painted gold by low-hanging sun, ice formations that shift and crack with ancient patience, and skies that transform from deep indigo to brilliant aurora in the span of a winter evening.</p>
                    
                    <p>These natural phenomena became my first teachers in color, texture, and composition. I found myself fascinated not by the literal representation of these elements, but by their emotional impact—the way morning light on basalt could evoke both strength and vulnerability, or how the subtle grays of a glacier could contain infinite depth and movement.</p>
                    
                    <p>My formal training began at the Iceland Academy of the Arts, where I explored various mediums before finding my voice in abstract expression. What draws me to abstraction is its ability to communicate the feeling of a place rather than its appearance. Each piece I create is an attempt to translate the raw energy and quiet poetry of Iceland's landscapes into something that can live and breathe in any space.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, working from my studio overlooking Reykjavík's colorful rooftops, I continue to draw inspiration from the interplay between Iceland's ancient geological forces and its ever-changing atmospheric conditions. Every commission becomes a collaboration between my artistic vision and the unique story of the space and person it's meant for.</p>

                    <h2>Artistic Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I believe that abstract art has the unique power to bypass our analytical minds and speak directly to our emotional core. My work is rooted in the conviction that color, texture, and form can convey experiences that words cannot fully capture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each painting begins with a feeling—perhaps the memory of standing before an ancient lava field at sunset, or the sensation of wind carrying fine volcanic sand across empty highlands. I layer colors and textures intuitively, allowing each mark to inform the next, building compositions that echo the organic processes that shaped Iceland's dramatic terrain.</p>
                    
                    <p>My process is one of discovery. I never know exactly where a piece will lead, but I trust in the dialogue between intention and spontaneity, between the planned and the unexpected. This approach mirrors the way Iceland's landscape itself was formed—through slow, patient geological processes punctuated by sudden, dramatic transformations.</p>

                    <h3>Materials</h3>
                    <p>I work primarily with high-quality acrylic paints for their vibrant pigments and quick-drying properties, often layering them with oil paints for depth and texture. My surfaces include primed canvas, wood panels, and occasionally handmade papers.</p>
                    <p>Texture is built through various techniques including palette knife work, sand and pumice additives, and collage elements sourced from Iceland's natural materials.</p>

                <div class="materials-item">
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Each piece begins with meditation on a specific natural memory or feeling. I start with broad washes of color, gradually building layers and allowing each to inform the next. The process is intuitive yet disciplined—I may work on a piece for weeks, letting it rest between sessions.</p>
                    <p>I photograph each stage, documenting the evolution and sometimes returning to earlier states if the piece calls for it.</p>

                <div class="materials-item">
                    <h3>Care Instructions</h3>
                    <p>All artworks are created with archival materials and properly sealed. Display away from direct sunlight and excessive humidity. Dust gently with a soft, dry cloth. Professional cleaning is recommended for deep cleaning.</p>
                    <p>Proper framing with UV-protective glass will ensure your piece remains vibrant for generations.</p>
